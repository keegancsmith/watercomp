<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>
TODO: fix
</p>

<p>
Molecular simulations runs for days on end, generating lots and lots of data
(gigabytes of data). Transferring and storing so much data is a problem, so the
solution is to compress the data. As water is often a large part of the
simulation, the project will be compressing the water data.
</p>

<p>
My project partners (Julian Kenwood and Keegan Smith) will be handling the
actual compression aspect of the project, while I will be handling the
visualisation aspect of the project.
</p>

<p>
The compression aspect will be using what is known about the characteristics of
water to better compression their positions, while the visualisation will aim
to provide a means of exploring and seeing how the water is behaving in the
molecular simulation.
