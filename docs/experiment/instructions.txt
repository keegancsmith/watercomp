 Instructions
==============

This experiment will be testing the quality of a compression technique. You
will be shown a molecular simulation, which you are free to explore and watch.

| The controls are:
|   Left click and drag to rotate the view
|   Mouse wheel to zoom in and out

The experiment will follow these steps:

1. The original data will be loaded. You will be comparing later data to this.
2. You can watch and explore the data as you want.
3. Another set of data will be loaded and shown to you.
4. Again, you can watch and explore the data as you want.
5. Once you are finished, you will be asked to indicate on a scale of 1 to 7
   how different is what was just shown and the original data. 1 being not
   different at all, 7 being very different.
6. The data should play for a minute, but you can stop watching when you have
   decided how different the data is.
7. This process will be repeated a number of times using different data at
   different compression levels.

There is no right or wrong answer. This experiment is purely to observe the
the compression quality.

This experiment is entirely voluntary, you are free to leave at any time
during the experiment.

Thank you for your time.

The experiment will start once you have filled in your details and are
ready.
