 Experimental design
=====================

Hypothesis
----------

To measure the perceptually visible effects of quantisation.


Test cases
----------

*d* different datasets

1. Protein in the middle
2. Small, water only
3. ... (*What else can we get?*)


*q* different quantisation levels

1. Unquantised 32 bit floats
2. 16 bit integers
3. 8  bit integers
4. 6  bit integers
5. 4  bit integers


*v* different visualisation techniques

1. Ball and stick
2. Metaballs view
3. Water cluster view (*Will testing 3 techniques be a bit much?*)
4. Quantisation error view (*Not in experiment*)
5. Water point view (*Not in experiment*)

*d* \* *q* \* *v* different tests


Variables
---------

The *q* different quantisation levels, with the *v* different visualisation
techniques.


Subjects
--------

30 people. (*Will this be enough?*)


Procedure
---------


1. The subject will be given a piece of paper explaining the experiment to
   them. This will be to avoid biasing the subject in any manner.
2. The original unquantised data will be loaded and the subject will be
   allowed to explore and view it.
3. Thereafter, the different quantised data will be loaded for the subject.
4. 33% of subjects will be shown the data in increasing order of quantisation.
5. 33% of subjects will be shown the data in decreasing order of quantisation.
6. 33% of subjects will be shown the data in a random order.
   (*Just show in a random order to everyone?*)
7. This procedure will be repeated using 2 visualisation techniques, with 2
   different datasets.
   The visualisation technique will be randomly chosen. Only 2 visualisation
   techniques will be used so as that not too much time of the subject is
   used.
8. After showing each quantised data, the subject will be asked to indicate on
   a scale of 1 to 10 how noticeable the difference is (not noticeable to very
   obvious).


Estimated time required to complete experiment:

5 minutes for the subject to read instructions, fill in details and indicate
their response.

(2 datasets)
\* (4+1 quantisation levels)
\* (2 visualisation techniques)
\* (1.5 minute per viewing)
= (30 minutes for experiment)

Total of ~35 minutes

(*Is 1.5 minutes per viewing too long? 1 minute enough?*)


Results / Outcomes
------------------

Given a specific visualisation technique and quantisation level, how
noticeable is the quantisation effect?
