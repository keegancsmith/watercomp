Introduction is sparse. Make the problem clear, why other methods have failed.
Emphasise the experiment more. Justify the implementation, e.g. provides a
framework for the test. Other systems are limited to what they can do, over
complicated, produce a testbed, infrastructure.

Refer to other people's work by component, not name.

Background, what I have learnt. Mention that nothing visualises water.
Move statistical analysis background into Background.

Explain what water clusters are.

Move the experiment design into Design chapter.

Combine the experiment procedure with the experiment results. Then have
discussion in a separate chapter, which discusses all the results.  Move or
highlight certain areas/columns of the tables of data.

Introduction is too general, provide context. Rephrase the problem statement,
to be a research question. Detail how and why the work is split up. Stress
that everything is compressed, not just the water molecules.

Refer to other people's work by component, not name.

Move the ethics section somewhere else, does not belong in the Introduction.
Into the Design chapter?

Explain what water clusters are.

In the Design chapter, emphasise the design goals. What are the key success
factors, problem statement.

New schemes should be in Design, not Implementation. Some of the schemes may
need some background? Experiment design should also be in the Design chapter.

Highlight results in the tables.
