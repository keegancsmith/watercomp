 Instructions
==============

This experiment will be testing how noticeable different quantisation levels
are. In simple terms, how noticeable is the precision of a decimal number.

The data that you will be shown is molecular data. Each atom will be
represented by a sphere in 3D space. You are free to watch and explore the
data as you want.

| The controls are:
|   Left click and drag to rotate the view
|   Mouse wheel to zoom in and out

The experiment will follow these steps:

1. The original data will be loaded. You will be comparing later data to this.
2. You can watch and explore the data as you want.
3. The same data but at a different quantisation level will be loaded for you.
4. Again, you can watch and explore the data as you want.
5. Once you are finished, you will be asked to indicate on a scale of 1 to 10
   how different is what was just shown and the original data. 1 being not
   different, 10 being very different.
6. Steps 3 to 5 will be repeated 3 more times with different quantisation
   levels.
7. This entire procedure will then be repeated for 2 different visualisations
   and 2 different datasets.

There is no right or wrong answer. This experiment is purely to observe the
effects of different quantisation levels.

This experiment is entirely voluntary, you are free to leave at any time
during the experiment.

No individually identifying information will be collected.

Thank you for your time.

The experiment will start once you have signed this page.
