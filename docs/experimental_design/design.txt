 Experimental design
=====================

Hypothesis
----------

To test the perceptually visible effects of quantisation.


Test cases
----------

.. Depends on how many different datasets we can get

*d* different datasets

1. Protein in the middle
2. Small, water only


.. Keegan/Julian: how many different quantisation levels will be tested?
.. And, what are they? I've gone in 8 bit increments for now

*q* different quantisation levels

1. Unquantised 32 bit floats
2. 32 bit integers
3. 24 bit integers
4. 16 bit integers
5. 8  bit integers


.. Maybe only use 2 techniques? Testing 3 techniques is a bit much?

*v* different visualisation techniques

1. Ball and stick
2. Metaballs view
3. Water cluster view

.. 4. Quantisation error view
.. 5. Water point view

*d* \* *q* \* *v* different tests


Variables
---------

The *q* different quantisation levels, with the *v* different visualisation
techniques.


Subjects
--------

30 people.

.. Will that be enough?


Procedure
---------


1. The subject will be given a piece of paper explaining the experiment to
   them. This will be to avoid biasing the subject in any manner.
2. The original unquantised data will be loaded and the subject will be
   allowed to explore and view it.
3. Thereafter, the different quantised data will be loaded for the subject.
4. 33% of subjects will be shown the data in increasing order of quantisation.
5. 33% of subjects will be shown the data in decreasing order of quantisation.
6. 33% of subjects will be shown the data in a random order.
   .. Just show in a random order to everyone?
7. This procedure will be repeated using 2 visualisation techniques, with 2
   different datasets.
   The visualisation technique will be randomly chosen. Only 2 visualisation
   techniques will be used so as that not too much time of the subject is
   used.
8. After showing each quantised data, the subject will be asked to indicate on
   a scale of 1 to 10 how noticeable the difference is (not noticeable to very
   obvious).


Estimated time required to complete experiment:

5 minutes for the subject to read instructions, fill in details and indicate
their response.

(2 datasets)
\* (4+1 quantisation levels)
\* (2 visualisation techniques)
\* (1.5 minute per viewing)
= (30 minutes for experiment)

.. Is 1.5 minutes per viewing too long? 1 minute enough?

Total of ~35 minutes


Results / Outcomes
------------------

What quantisation level is the most noticeable.
