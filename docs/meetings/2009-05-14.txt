====================================
 Minutes from Meeting May 14th 2009
====================================

General
=======

* Pitching level - Average honours student. (So explain terms etc)
* Keep related work a lot smaller, so only most important things.
* We can use personal communication with John Stone for why our paper is
  important. Intro will also mention why it is important.
* We need to say we dont have any IP or User worries.
* Make a gantt chart. Talk about risks and how to deal with it
* Have early milestones with defined interfaces. (Deals with risk)
* For examples of good proposals, look at panopticon & robot wii proposals.
* Be high level in the presentation and show break up of work.


Research questions
==================

We need metrics/factors to measure the success of our research questions.

* Grand Question: Can we increase the ratio of compression on other methods in an efficient way?

* Min-Young

  + What quantisation can we accept from a visual perspective
  + How to do level of detail (show important bits)
  + Do real time display

* Julian

  + Space, Time effeciency with good compression ratios
  + Are we doing better than other methods?
  + Does putting oct stuff in work?

* Keegan

  + Assuming what we know about water, can we exploit it to get good
    compression ratios.
  + Can we do better than Devilliers
  + Can we improve in naive graph using hueristics (kind of related to first
    point)


Outcomes
========

* Exploit structure of water to improve compression
* Use good quantisation
* Possible integration with UMD
