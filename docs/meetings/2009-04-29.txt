Julian is doing:
- Encoding of state
- Decode of state
- Compression of state
- Decompression of state
- Implementation of reference schemes and use of standard compression technique
- Prediction scheme.
- Possibly bounding volume.
- I/O of compressed/uncompressed data

Min-Young is doing:
- I/O of uncompressed data.
- Quantisation of space
- Visualisation
- User evaluation of the visualisations

Keegan is doing:
- Bond Extraction
- Graph Representation
- Part of encoding
- Some proof of encoding optimality or near optimality or something

From what I recall
- Julian's literature survey is on Compression
- Min-Young's literature survey is on visualisation techniques(?) of molecules.
- Keegan's literature survey is on Point cloud compression.
