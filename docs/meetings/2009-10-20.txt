 Minutes of Meeting Tuesday 20 October 2009
============================================


Julian
======

* Generated lots of test data
* Don't need more test data
* Starting writing this week
* Possibly run tests on a separate machine
* Can talk how we generated test data

Keegan
======

* Wrote Gumhold compressor. Works better than Devillers and Gandoin.
* Wrote water compressor.

  + Predicts hydrogen to be at oxygen position.
  + Needs to improve compression of non water atoms.

* Going to change compressor to write every different part of the compressor
  to separate files to get statistics.
* Need to implement statistics on how well the predictions are working
* Starting writing

Ethics Chapter
==============

* Talk about OSS libraries
* Talk about libraries and licences we use.
* Quantisation degrading quality of simulations
* Our product is not commercial, free and for academics.

Quantisation
============

* We should make it so quantised cells are roughly cubes. We currently don't
  do this, but in all our test data the bounding box is roughly a cube, so are
  the cells.
* Do tests on 8, 12 and 16 bit quantisation.

Drafts
======

* Julian and Min-Young should hand in draft to James.
* Keegan should hand in draft to Patrick.
