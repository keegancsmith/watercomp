 Minutes of Meeting Tuesday 29 September 2009
===============================================

Discussion
==========

* Buckle down and get a basic version working.
* Focus of the project is experimenting on different techniques, predictors, etc.
* Get one visualisation technique done first, not two half done.


Visualisation
=============

* Focus on getting metaballs complete.
* Using ribbons for water cluster won't work since there's multiple connections
  per water molecule. Alternative is to use generalised cylinders. The water
  molecules are just points along a tube that bends, splits and joins. Tube is
  a series of circles/cylinders following a path.
* Decimation should use a simple implementation, get something working.
  ('94 Siggraph paper)
* User experients...
  + Experiments should be around quantisation levels detectable by user.
  + Have several visualisations, quantisation levels, see what is noticeable.


Compression
===========

* Compression should be compared before and after quantisation.


General
=======

* Quantisation could make data extra jittery? This could cause large perceptual
  errors.
