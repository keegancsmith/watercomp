===============================================

Discussion
==========

Julian

* Design Chapter 
  + Returned with comments: More design choices than the design itself.
  

Keegan
------
* Testing
  + Testing would go in the results section; for instance proof that system does what it is meant to.

Min

* Coarse subdivision or decimation for marching tetrahedra?
  + Decimation is preferred.
