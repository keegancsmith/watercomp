===========================================
 Minutes of Meeting Tuesday 6 October 2009
===========================================


Julian
======

* Do a rigorous analysis of all the parameters and different data
* A fallback for data is to either use NAMD, and/or ask Michelle
* A possible interframe prediction scheme is to use interpolation splines
* Kalman filters might be worth trying, might be too expensive
* The water movements might be to random


Min-Young
=========

* Get 3 main visualisations for the experimentation
* Produce an experimental design

  + 1 page
  + Hypothesis (perceptual testing)
  + Test cases
  + Variables (quantisation levels)
  + Test cases
  + Subjects (chemists or general)
  + Statistics
  + Side by side analysis or show series

* To reduce clutter, only show a few water molecules


Keegan
======

* Permutation compression: fewer values are left as the permutation is
  compressed

  + The frequency values decreases as the symbols are used

* Use scanline ordering so that the permutation compresses better?
* Interframe index changer?


General
=======

* Compression may be poor due to file format, worth mentioning

  + Propose new file format or mention limitations
