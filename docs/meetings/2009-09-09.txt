===============================================
 Minutes of Meeting Wednesday 9 September 2009
===============================================


Technical issues
================

* Ignoring order of water molecules in data
 + May be important, follow up with Michelle and John Stone
 + Using previous frame to id the water molecules can work (distance rank)

* Clusters of water, i.e. cluster and inter-cluster prediction schemes
 + See how it goes, simple implementation first
 + Experimentation


General issues
==============

* Need test data
 + Single frame should fit in memory (acceptable requirement)
 + Follow up with list of types of required test data (research types)
 + Range of sizes, instances, etc.

* Have a meeting once a week (Tuesdays)


Visualisation (Min-Young)
=========================

* Visualisation for compression (debugging/developing compression)
* Alpha effects
* Error visualising with colour
* Colour standard deviation (metro library)
* High level grouping
* Selecting areas
* Visualising chains


Report
======

* Mention everything that was done
 + Julian - ANN, grid divisioning or any other different schemes
 + Julian - Arithmetic Coding implementation (if any)

* Background chapter
 + Julian & Keegan - Cover all compression techniques (Gandoin AND
     Omeltchenko), report should stand by itself
 + Keegan - Heuristics for water
 + Min-Young - Visualising uncertainty, error visualisation, colour gradients

* Don't forget results and validation chapters
 + Simple lossless check (quantised data to compressed, decompressed data)
 + Statistics of quantisation
 + Prediction statistics
 + Histogram of standard deviation of error, should mostly be [0, 1]
