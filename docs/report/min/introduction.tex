Molecular simulations typically generate massive amounts of data. A large
simulation can comprise hundreds of thousands of atoms, with thousands of
frames.  Multiplying the two dimensions together yields many gigabytes of data.
Due to the computational costs and time required in performing these
simulations, they are often run on clusters, which means that the generated
data needs to be transferred from the cluster to a researchers' workstation.
Compressing the molecular data is thus advantageous as it will make the
transferring the data faster, as well as decreasing the storage costs of the
molecular simulation data.

% TODO: why large amounts of water?
A large proportion of the volume in many molecular simulations is water, which
has certain characteristics that can be exploited to achieve good compression.
The water compression project thus targets molecular simulations with large
amounts of water, aiming to achieve high compression ratios by exploiting
certain characteristics of the data.

Due to molecular simulation being composed of a sequence of frames of data,
where a single frame is a snapshot of the positions of all the atoms,
compressing the molecular simulation can be broken up into: compressing a
single frame (intraframe compression), and compressing data across frames
(interframe compression).

Our water compression project is thus split into three main parts:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Intraframe compression
  \item Interframe compression
  \item Visualisation
\end{itemize}

The visualisation aspect of the project supports the main goal of the project:
compressing molecular simulations. To do so, the molecular simulation data will
need to be visualised, and a quantisation experiment carried out. Quantisation
is converting the original floating point values to integer values, this is to
facilitate compressing the molecular data as integers can be more effectively
compressed.

This report will focus on the visualisation aspect of the water compression
project. The intraframe compression is completed by Keegan Smith, while the
interframe compression is completed by Julian Kenwood.

The remainder of this report is structured as follows:

Chapter \ref{cha:background} provides background on relevant visualisation
techniques that influenced the development of our visualisation.

A number of visualisation solutions are identified and detailed in Chapter
\ref{cha:design}. The chapter explains why these approaches are chosen and the
design behind them. A few of the visualisation approaches are aimed purely at
supporting the compressors.

Chapter \ref{cha:implementation} provides implementation details on each of the
visualisation components.

The second part of the visualisation aspect of the system, the quantisation
experiment, is detailed in Chapter \ref{cha:experiment}. The experiment results
and analysis is also in Chapter \ref{cha:experiment}.

Finally, Chapter \ref{cha:conclusion} concludes and summarises this project.
