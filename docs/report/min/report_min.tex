\section{Introduction}
Molecular data is composed of many interconnected atoms and interacting
molecules, this poses a problem for visualisation: how do you effectively
visualise a large number of objects in 3D space? The complex diagrams that arise
from basic visualisation techniques will be hard to analyse and identify
structures due to the large number of objects and extraneous data.

Although there are several different visualisation techniques that have been
developed, how they cope with many objects in 3D space will need to be
evaluated. Another aspect that is often neglected is the temporal aspect, data
changes over time and this should also be reflected in the visualisation.

In order to get some perspective on what some of the existing visualisation
techniques are, this paper will look at some of the molecular modelling and
visualisation techniques, as well as some general visualisation techniques
applicable to molecular data.

Information visualisation techniques are very domain specific; one type of
visualisation may work well for a specific scenario, but will work quite poorly
when applied to another domain. The problem domain that this literature survey
is aiming to investigate is on how to effectively visualise point cloud data
that is being constantly updated. Some of the issues that will be need to be
investigated will be the level of detail chosen, how time is handled in the
visualisation and how easily it will be to see what is happening (such as
interactions with objects).

This literature survey will thus concentrate on molecular modelling and
visualisation techniques, but will also include some general volume rendering
and clutter reduction techniques as they do have some relevance to visualising
point cloud data.

Section 2 will identify and briefly introduce several molecular visualisation
techniques. While section 3 will focus on general visualisation techniques with
regards to volume visualisation and clutter reduction. Possible applications
will also be noted with regards to point cloud visualisation.


\section{Molecular modelling and visualisation techniques}

As will be seen, the most significant problem for visualising molecular data is
the amount of data available and how to represent them so as not to clutter up
the display. Some of the molecular visualisation techniques focuses on
simplifying the models, by analysing the data to identify structures; while some
exclude certain data from the visualisation. Either way, a more simplified image
is presented so as to make it easier and quicker to understand.

The more specific visualisation techniques (ribbon, paper chain and twister) are
designed for very specific molecular objects, thus they will not be easily
extendable to point cloud data. They can however be used to see what kind of
analysis can be done on data to simplify and help identify structures.

It is worth mentioning the Visual Molecular Dynamics \citep{humphrey96} program,
which is a commonly used visualisation package aimed at displaying, animating
and analysing large biomolecular systems \citep{VMD}. VMD provides many
different visualisation techniques and modes that can be combined so that
multiple different techniques are used for a single display. VMD does support
and use some of the visualisation techniques that will be mentioned later in
this paper.

\subsection*{Ball-and-stick}
The ball-and-stick model is the classical approach to displaying molecular
structure. Colour coded spheres are used to represent the atoms, while cylinders
are used to represent the bonds between them. This model is used to emphasise
the molecular connectivity of the atoms. This is the simplest of approaches to
molecular visualisation and is also used when all the detail is required,
typically for looking at bond information and reaction sites.

The problem with this model is that it does not handle large numbers of atoms
and bonds very well. By having all the atoms and bonds visible, the image
quickly becomes crowded and overall structure is obscured. Occlusion of other
atoms often occurs which may hide important information. Ball-and-stick diagrams
are typically not used for large or many molecules as it typically produces the
most cluttered diagrams, making it very difficult to understand and analyse.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=70mm]{BallStick}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Ball-and-stick model}
  \label{fig:ballstick}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{CPK}
The CPK (Corey-Pauling-Koltun) \citep{corey53} representation simplifies the
ball-and-stick model by doing away with cylinders for bonds; instead, the
spheres used for the atoms are enlarged to encompass the bonds. The `atoms' now
overlap with one another, covering up where the bonds would be.

Removing the bonds from the model representation simplifies the display and
allows for the overall shape and contour to be easily seen. Although this model
has simplified the ball-and-stick model, it does not highlight any structures,
it has only removed the bond information. The later molecular visualisation
techniques in this paper do highlight certain molecular structures.

The CPK representation also suffers from not being able to visualise large
numbers of molecules. As each of the atoms has been enlarged, each molecule
essentially occupies more space than the ball-and-stick model; with the
molecules being opaque, this causes large areas to be occluded from sight, which
may hide important information and make it hard to analyse an entire system.

  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=70mm]{CPK-big}
  \end{center}
  \caption{CPK}
  \label{fig:cpkbig}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Ribbon}
The ribbon model \citep{richardson81}, \citep{carson87} was designed to
highlight the structure of protein molecules by fitting a curved surface to the
backbone of the molecule. This allows for the shape of the protein molecule to
be easily seen and followed.

This proved to be highly effective at highlighting the structure of proteins;
unfortunately this approach is not as effective when applied to non-protein
molecules such as carbohydrates and lipids, where the molecular structure is
different. Thus, the traditional ball-and-stick and CPK models do still get
used for carbohydrate and lipid molecules.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=70mm]{ribbon}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Ribbon}
  \label{fig:ribbon}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Paper chain}
The paper chain visualisation technique \citep{kuttel06} focuses on highlighting
ring structures in carbohydrate molecules. Ring structures are first identified
and then are displayed using a ring polyhedron.

This significantly simplifies the carbohydrate molecules by only showing the
carbohydrate rings, which would of otherwise been obscured by the other
visualisations (ball-and-stick and CPK). The ball-and-stick model can still be
overlayed on the paper chain diagram to provide detailed information if needed.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=70mm]{paper_chain}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Paper chain}
  \label{fig:paperchain}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Twister}
The twister visualisation technique \citep{kuttel06} follows from the paper
chain technique by highlighting the relative orientations of the identified
carbohydrate rings. Each carbohydrate ring is represented by a disc, which is
then connected to another disc with a ribbon. The ribbon will follow the
orientation from one ring to another, thus showing how the rings are connected
to one another.

This is similar to the ribbon model for proteins in that it shows the overall
shape of the molecule quite effectively. Previously, following the shape and
twisting of the carbohydrate molecules would be very difficult as that would be
obscured by all the atoms that make up the carbohydrate molecule.

\section{General data visualisation techniques}

There has been considerably more research done in general data visualisation
techniques than that of molecular visualisations. The most relevant areas of
research to point cloud visualisation: volume visualisation and clutter
reduction, will be looked at in this section. Possible applications and uses
with regards to point cloud data will be mentioned and noted with the different
techniques.

\subsection*{Volume visualisation}
Traditional volume visualisation techniques work on volumes of data, such as
those gotten from CT and MRI scans. The main uses of such data would be surface
extraction, finding the shape of the volume; and volume rendering, rendering the
volume such that the volume in its entirety is visible. These techniques can be
applied to point cloud data, although the uses would be quite specific.

This paper will only mention the basic different techniques and will not provide
much detail on the individual algorithms. There has also been significant
advances in each of the techniques \citep{brodlie01}, which will not be
mentioned in this paper.

\subsubsection*{Surface extraction}
Surface extraction is for determining the surface of the volume that is of
interest. The marching cubes algorithm \citep{lorensen87} is the classical
approach for surface extraction. The algorithm works by examining each cell in
the volume (a cube) and determining whether it is part of the interested in
volume or not. A surface can then be determined by combining all the cells which
intersect with the volume boundary.

Surface extraction allows for the shape of the volume to be extracted and be
easily seen, this is somewhat analogous to the CPK model in that regard. Surface
extraction can be adapted to molecular data to provide a simpler and smoothed
view of the molecule, so that the shape and contours can be more plainly seen;
which may of otherwise been obscured by the individual atoms.

This technique can also be used to identify volumes of space where points are
missing, thus highlighting these areas. However, the basic algorithm would need
to be adapted significantly to cope with large open spaces.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=70mm]{triangulated_mesh}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Surface extraction}
  \label{fig:triangulatedmesh}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{Volume rendering}
The second volume visualisation technique is volume rendering, it aims to
visualise the entire volume instead of a subset. This is done by modelling the
data as a translucent gel so that you are able to see through the volume, while
still being able to see what is in the volume at the same time.

There are two main approaches to volume rendering; the first is working from the
image plane to the volume, this is called image order processing. Ray casting is
the classical approach to this as proposed by \citet{levoy88}. Object order
processing is working from the volume to the image plane. The classical approach
to this is splatting \citep{westover89}. Hybrid methods have been developed to
take advantage of both approaches.

The advantage of volume rendering is being able to visualise the entire volume
at once, but does come at the cost increased complexity and computation. There
are potential uses for volume rendering within a molecular environment if there
is a need to see molecular structure which may otherwise be obscured by other
molecules or atoms. However, often the problem is too much information rather
than obscuring information.

Volume rendering may be useful in point cloud visualisations as this would
enable the entire volume to be `visible', hence dealing with the potential
problem of having many occluding entities. The computation costs involved with
such a visualisation technique would have to weighed with the benefits that this
approach would provide.

    \includegraphics[width=70mm]{head_volume}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Volume rendering}
  \label{fig:headvolume}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Metaballs}
Related to solvent accessible surfaces.

Uses marching cubes to extract surface.
Advantage is being able to see groupings.
Disadvantage is computation cost.

    \includegraphics[width=70mm]{metaballs}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Metaballs}
  \label{fig:metaballs}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Clutter reduction}
Shneiderman provides a visual information-seeking mantra \citep{shneiderman96}:
``overview first, zoom and filter, then details on demand'', in which clutter
reduction techniques fit in quite well. The mantra provides a general hierarchy
of tasks that is to be applied to information visualisation, in which clutter
reduction plays an important role.

\citet{ellis07} provides a taxonomy containing many clutter reduction techniques
against many criteria. With clutter reduction, a balance between removing too
much and too little information must be made. Removing too much or too little
would make visualisation of little use.

With regards to visualising point cloud data, filtering, opacity and topological
distortion may be the most useful clutter reduction techniques.

Filtering is only displaying certain items fulfilling a criteria. This can be
used to only show items in a certain area or locus of interest, irrelevant items
can be removed and not clutter up the display. This may be useful for removing
uninterested in occluding objects and only show points at important areas, such
at where there is interaction occurring.

Another approach to filtering is to highlight the important features of the
data, but leave the rest of the data visible. This adds the advantage of
keeping a context for data.

Opacity is changing the translucency of items to highlight or hide things. This
is similar to filtering in that irrelevant items are partially or entirely
hidden, highlighting only the important parts. The advantage of opacity over
filtering is that the other information is not entirely removed, it is still
available if needed and can be used to hint at contextual information. Opacity
can also be adapted to show temporal information, where the previous frame is
rendered along with the current frame, but at a lower opacity; this would have a
similar effect to motion blur.

Topological distortion is changing the view so that certain areas are larger.
Thus highlighting and bringing to focus the relevant area, while de-emphasising
the other areas. The distortion can either be uniform (zooming), or can be
non-uniform (fish-eye effect).

Clutter reduction techniques has the most potential for point cloud
visualisation as there is a need to be able to visualise many objects in 3D
space, however care must be taken to not remove important and relevant
information. It should be noted that the clutter reduction techniques are not
all mutually exclusive, many of the techniques can be used to complement and be
layered on top of one another.

\section{Conclusion}
This paper has gone through some visualisation techniques, each with their own
advantages and disadvantages. Visualisation techniques are all quite specific
and are designed for their respective scenarios, fulfilling their respective
requirements and taking advantage of specific domain knowledge; as a result,
they are not easily generalisable into other areas.

Molecular modelling is a specific instance of the information visualisation
problem, where the requirement is to be able to easily identify certain
structures. Different types of molecules will each have their own specific
characteristics and structures, this knowledge can be taken advantage of in the
different visualisation techniques: ribbon diagrams are useful for proteins,
paper chain and twister for carbohydrates, while ball-and-stick and CPK for
general molecular visualisations.

General visualisation techniques address a slightly different problem; the
problem being solved is how to be able to visualise the data effectively and
not necessarily to identify and highlight certain structures. Identifying the
structures is often domain specific and thus approaches are not easily
extendable to their domains, thus the main concern is how to enable easy
exploration of the data.

None of the techniques touched on, handle a temporal aspect explicitly. If a
temporal dimension were to be added, all the techniques would just treat each
frame separately and regenerate the visualisation given the new set of data.
This approach would not be ideal if some inter-frame visualisation coherence is
desired. This aspect in information visualisation is quite lacking and thus ways
of visualising temporal information will need to be developed.

There is no one solution for all visualisation needs, however approaches and
ideas can be taken from different visualisation areas. Although the problems
may not be identical, there will be some overlapping requirements and concerns.
As mentioned in the introduction, visualisation techniques are very domain
specific, with their own requirements and concerns.
